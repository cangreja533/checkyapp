##### UMA PROTOCOL

We follow along UMA PROTOCOL's documentation. 👉 https://docs.umaproject.org/, they have all of the info on how the oracle works and it's filled out correctly. 

We started as any smartcontract (using Remix IDE) by iniciating it. We did exactly what the documentation told us to while getting started. We follow this example: 👉 https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.js&optimize=false&runs=200&gist=fba5d2812d940759f4f7585741b529a4

Then with some help, we arranged to have a variable (that is for now setted) that's called ancillry data, please note that this is a simplified form of ancillry data to work as an example.

We submitted the data to the oracle and give it time (60 seconds) to verify it, it could be up to us that type of timestamp entry. 
We connect to the smart contract, and then we connect to Oracle. So then within the timestamp we have our staking being placed. 

##### WALLET CONNECT

Wallet Connect is an open source protocol for connecting decentralised applications to mobile wallets with QR code scanning or deep linking, we are really interested in having them here due to it's ease to use wallets without downloading any apps. #EasyPeasyLemonSquizy 🍋
