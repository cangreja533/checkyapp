# What do we want, and how do we do it. 👊

##### UMA PROTOCOL 
We follow along UMA PROTOCOL's documentation. 👉 https://docs.umaproject.org/, they have all of the info on how the oracle works and it's filled out correctly. 

We started as any smartcontract (using Remix IDE) by iniciating it. We did exactly what the documentation told us to while getting started. We follow this example: 👉 https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.js&optimize=false&runs=200&gist=fba5d2812d940759f4f7585741b529a4

Then with some help, we arranged to have a variable (that is for now setted) that's called ancillry data, please note that this is a simplified form of ancillry data to work as an example.

We submitted the data to the oracle and give it time (60 seconds) to verify it, it could be up to us that type of timestamp entry.
